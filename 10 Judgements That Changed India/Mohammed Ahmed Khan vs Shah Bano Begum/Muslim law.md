The Constitution Bench delivered a unanimous verdict.<br>
First, the court alluded to the religious neutrality of Section 125.<br>
Its interpretation was that the underlying purpose of Section 125 was to protect dependents from vagrancy and destitution.<br>
Thus it saw no reason to exclude Muslims from its sweeping ambit.<br>
The court distnguished between the subject areas coverd my Muslim Personal Law and Section 125.<br>
According to it, Muslim Personal Law did not addredd the situation envisaged in Section 125.<br>
The personal law did not contemplate the scenario where tyhe wife wasnunable to maintain herself after the period of <i>iddat</i>.<br>
In such case, she would be entitled to seek maintenance under Section 125.<br>
In any event, the court stated if there was preceived conflict between the two, CrPC would override the provisions of Muslim Personal Law.<br>
