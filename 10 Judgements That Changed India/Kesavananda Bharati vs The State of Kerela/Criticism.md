The nexus between the doctrine and the Constitution as it has been codified can be attributed more accurately to spirit than to text.<br>
In fact, <i>Golak Nath</i> finds more support from constitutional texts than <i>Kesvananda</i>.<br>
Apart from this, <i>Kesvananda</i> has been condemned for being too lengthy, thus causing uncertainity about what the 11 opinions collectively mean.<br>
Judgement has been decribed as one that provides an 'outstanding study on lack of consensus'.<br>
This was being called counter-majoritarian, and one that causes democratuc imbalance. Why?<br>
It gives power over constitutional amendments to Supreme Court, an <b>unelected</b> and <b>self-appointed</b> body.<br>
The Supreme Court's message in <i>Kesvananda</i> was clear:<br><br>
&emsp;<b>If any constitutional authority was going to wield substantial power over constitutional interpretation inconsistent with the traditional democratic process, it would be the <u>judiciary</u></b>.<br>
