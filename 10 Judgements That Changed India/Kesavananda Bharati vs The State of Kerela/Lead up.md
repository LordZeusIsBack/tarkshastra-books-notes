His Holiness Swami Kesavananda Bharati Sripadagalvaru was head of Eldeer Math in Kerala.<br>
Kerela Land Refroms Act, 1963, had affecetde the property of his religious institution.<br>
While the proceeding were underway, the Parliament inderted certain laws in the 9<sup>th</sup> Schedule.<br>
Nani Palkhivala, the petitioner's counsel, seized the opportunity and challenged the validity of 24<sup>th</sup>, 25<sup>th</sup> and 29<sup>th</sup> Amendments.<br>

<ol>
<li> According to 24<sup>th</sup> Amendment, Constitutional amendments were not 'law' under Article 13.</li><br>
<li> According to 25<sup>th</sup> Amendment, gave Articles 39(b) and 39(c). This gave precedence of fundamental roght to equality, 7 fundamental freedoms and property. It took away power of courts on laws passed related to them.</li><br>
<li> 29<sup>th</sup> Amendment added 2 land reforms into 9<sup>th</sup> Schedule.</li><br>
</ol>
The Supreme Court had to recomsider their judgements in <i>Shankari Prasad</i>, <i>Sajjan Singh</i> and <i>Golak Nath</i>.<br>
The most important question was that how much amending power was to be given to the Parliament under Article 368.<br>
The petitioners in <i>Kesvananda</i> contended that the challenged amendments nullify the most cardinal principles of out constitution.<br>
On the other hand, the Parliament argued that there was no limit the amending power under Article 368 - the Parliament could do anything short of repealing the Constitution itself.<br>
13 judges sat <i>en banc</i> for almost 5 months to consider the question that stood to define constitutionalism and exercise of democratic power in India.<br>
