Agrarian land reform legislation was inacted in Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh.<br>
Zamindars filed petitions in diffeernt High Courts demanding that their fundamental right was being infringed.<br>
&emsp;Bingar Land Reforms Act, 1950 was invalidated by Patna High Court in 1951.<br>
In 1951, the Constituent Assembly passed the First Amendment, 1951.<br>
It inserted two provisions into the constitution.<br>
&emsp;Article 31A and 31B.<br>
One of these articles, 31A, became the basis of the Nineth Schedule (It basically talks about laws which cannot be challenged like land reforms).<br><br>
Zamindars then proceeded to challenge the amendment itself in <i>Shankari Prasad v. Union of India</i>.<br>
One of the several grounds of challenge was that the expression 'law' under article 13(2), which prohibits Parliament from making any laws that abridge or take away fundamental rights.<br>
If the court accepted this contention it would have implied that Part III (which talks about fundamental rights) could never be amended by the Parliament.<br>
However, a 5-judge bench unanimously rejected this arguement.<br>
The net effect of the Supreme Court's decision in <i>Shankari Prasad</i> was that amendments to the Constitution could not be reviewed by the courts.<br>
