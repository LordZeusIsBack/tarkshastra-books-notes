A hotly contested question among scholars of constitutional law is the basic structure doctrine, formulated at the of an oppressive era of single-party dominance, has crossed its expiry date.<br>
In the era of coalition politics, it is very unlikely that any party will wield the power that the Indira government exercised in the 1970's.<br>
&emsp;Yet, if one had to choose between the legislatire and judiciary as custodian of the Constitution, it would likely be the latter.<br>
Although the <i>Kesavananda</i> decision does not find favour with those have been brought up with the traditional concept of judicial review.<br>
Even sceptics would admit that it was the judiciary's rescue operation that saved Indian democracy.<br>
A hypothcucal question before we close this chapter:<br>
&emsp;If we accept the argument of those who oppose the basic structure, how can we discard it?<br>
Since the system of binding precedents in India rests on the principle of law that a judgement represents a decision of the entire bench of judges (not only those in the majority).<br>
Another bench consisting of at least 13 would have to be constituted to reconsider <i>Kesavananda</i>.<br>
Moreover, since <i>Kesavananda</i>, by its very nature, cannot be overruled by the legitimate exercise of legislative power, the only other method of doing so would be through extra-constitutional means.<br>
In any event, as a safety valve to preserve Indian democracy, the basic structure doctrine in <i>Kesavananda</i> should live on.
