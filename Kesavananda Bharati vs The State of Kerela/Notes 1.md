Clash between the judiciary and the legislature.
Judgement delivered on 24 April, 1973.
It was unique for a number of reasons. 1. Anxious political circunstancees under which it was delivered (Attempts by Indira Gandhi-led INC Government to pass radical constitutional amendments.) 2. Shift in the balance of democratic power it caused. 3. The unprecedented number of separate opinions delilvered by the Court.
Longest case in the history of the country.
Judgement spans 800 pages and about 420000 words long.
Termed as "Longest Apellate Decision" of the last century.
Supreme Court ascribed to itself the function of preserving the integrity of the Indian Constitution.
This case analysis is incomplete without brief discussion of cases which led up to this judgement.
