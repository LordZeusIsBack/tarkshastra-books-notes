During the Emergency, the Parliament passed the most controversial and revolutionary of the constitutional amendments 42<sup>nd</sup> Amendment, 1976.<br>
Enacted to eliminate 'impediments to the growth of the Constitution' the amendment virtually remoulded the original Constitution through sweeping changes.<br>
Within a couple of years of passing, the owners of textile mills in Karnataka challenged the government's nationalization.<br>
In <i>Minerva Mills v. Union of India</i>, the petitioners challenged the validity of section 55 of 42<sup>nd</sup> Amendment which increased the amending power of Parliament into an unlimited one under Article 368.<br>
The Supreme Court unanimously struck down the amendments to Article 368.<br>
The court's logic was simple - if a donee was vested with limited power, it could not be permitted to exercise that very power and convert it into unlimited one.<br>
<i>Minerva Mills</i> was the last case in which government made a concentrated effort to establish parliamentary supremacy.<br>
<i>Minerva Mills</i> marks the beginning of an era of judicial supremacy in India, with the Supreme Court firmly entrenched as the final arbiter of constitutional interpretation in India.<br>
