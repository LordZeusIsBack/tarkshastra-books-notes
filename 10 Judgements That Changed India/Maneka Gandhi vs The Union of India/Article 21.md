Before discussing the Supreme Court's decision in <i>Maneka Gandhi</i>, it is important to note the rigid approach taken up by the Apex Court.<br>

<ul>
<li>Each fundamental right is distinct and must be read in isolation.</li>
<li>The expression 'personal liberty' under article 21 excludes those freedoms that are present in article 19.</li>
</ul>
These cases were cited numerous times in the judgement of <i>Maneka Gandhi</i> case.<br>
In <i>Maneka Gandhi</i>, the Supreme Court departmented from the straitjacked interpretation of fundamental rights.<br>
This in a simpler language would mean:<br><br><br>
<p style="text-align: center;">
The mere fact that a law specified the requirements of one fundamental right,<br>
does not exempt it from the operation of other fundamental rights.<br>
</p>

This in turn means that is a law complied with its requirements, it would also have to satisfy the requirements of other fundamental rights.<br>
The majority of the bench were of the thinking that any aw established under article 21 would have to be 'fair, just and reasonable' unlike the impounding order issued by the GOI.<br>
The court affirmed the decision in <i>Satwant Singh</i> and held that the right to travel abroad fell within the sweep of the right of personal liberty.<br>
