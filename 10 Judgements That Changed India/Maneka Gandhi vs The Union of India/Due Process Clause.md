Does a law that satisfies all procedural requirements in its enacment, howevere arbitrary meet the test of artice 21?<br>
The Supreme Court wanted to answer this question in <i>Maneka Gandhi</i>.<br>
By vesting in itself the power, the Supreme Court transformed itself from being merely a supervisor to being the watchdog on the Indian Constitution.<br>
The key difference between <i>Satwant Singh</i> and <i>Maneka Gandhi</i> was that:<br>
&emsp;In <i>Satwant Singh</i>, the court objected due to the absence of law.<br>
&emsp;In <i>Maneka Gandhi</i>, the ourt's judgement is based on a simple premise that an arbitrary law is no law.<br>
Although makers of the Indian Constitution rejected the Americanised due process law.<br>
The Supreme Court's decision in <i>Maneka Gandhi</i> meant that 'procedure established by the law' under article 21 would have same effect.<br>
Supreme Court Stated that the article 21 would read as:<br>

<p style="text-align:center;">
No person shall be deprieved of his life or personal liberty except according to <i>fair, just and reasonable</i> established by the law.
</p>

<i>Maneka Gandhi</i> signifies court's changing approach towards the Constitution.<br>
In the decades that followed, it was treated as a 'living document', whose interpretation must evolve with times.<br>
Subtantive due process and, more broadly stated, the court's power to review the content of legislation to ascertain if the mandte of artocle 21 had been met, eventually found its way to the Indian Constitution.<br>
