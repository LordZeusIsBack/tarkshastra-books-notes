In <i>Kesvananda</i>, the Supreme Court made a strategic retreat over amendments to fundamental rights, but broadened the scope of its judicial review by assuming the power to scrutinize all constitutional amendments.<br>
If the Parliament had unfettered right to amend the Constitution, the Supreme Court had a coextensive power to review and invalidate any amendment.<br>
<i>Kesvananda</i> recognizes the distiinction between drafting and working of the Constitution.<br>
Targeting a very basic question:<br>
&emsp;<b>Can representative bodies, whose amending power is untrammelled, virtually redraft the Constitution on the pretense of making amendments to it?<br></b>
by limiting Parliament's power power to amend the Constitution, the Supreme Court pre-empted such a scenario and ensured that the people's representatives - meant to be servants of the Constitution - would not become its masters.<br>
The basic structure doctrine postulated in <i>Kesvananda</i> has been credited with protecting the Indian state from collapsing like many of its South Asian conuterparts, whether through totalitarian rule, military coups or other extra-constitutional means.<br>
These decisions were the kind where judges primarily decided on the ends, and then set out to discover the legal means to achieve those predetermined ends.<br><br>
Yet,the power to determine the parts of the Constitution that qualify as 'basic' rests with the Supreme Court, whose interpretation is fluid-the court being a perpetual and indissoluble institution. It is through this interesting arrangement that the stability of basic values is tinged with a little flexibility, and the Supreme Court becomes the safety valve that decides when stability is shaken too much for the well-being of the nation.<br>
