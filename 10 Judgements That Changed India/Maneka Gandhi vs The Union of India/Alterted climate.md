Some ask, why so much exitement over a verdict, which esstentially said that a person of India's most influential political family can go abroad.<br>
It is not the case which garnered exitement, but the constitutional developments after the case which highlight the importance of this case.<br>
The court transformed from being pedantic to purposive.<br>
This judgement became a springboard for evolution of the law relating to judicial preservation of human rights.<br>
The most important sacept of Supreme Court's introduction of substantive due process clause was that it led to expansion of right to life under the Constitution.<br>
From article 21, these rights cover areas such that rights of prisoner, protection of women, and children, and environmental rights.<br>
Rights included under article 21 after <i>Maneka Gandhi</i> include:

<ol>
<li><b>Rights of Prisoner</b> including protection from handcuffing without adequate reasons, access to transcript of judgement and facilities to exercise his right to appeal against conviction etc.</li>
<li><b>Environmental Rights</b> including the right to a humane and healthy environement, right to sustainable developement, protection from pollution hazards due to use of pesticides etc.</li>
<li><b>Other Rights</b> including the right to live with human dignity, including access to nutrition, clothing, and shelter, the right to free educatoin of children upto age of 14 etc.</li>
</ol>
