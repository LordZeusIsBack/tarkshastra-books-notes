The critical question before the 9 judge bench of the Supreme Court in <i>I.R. Coelho v. State of Tamil Nadu</i> was whether after <i>Kesvananda</i>, statures could be added into the 9<sup>th</sup> Schedule and exempt them from satisfying fundamental rights.<br>
The Supreme Court held that while laws could be added to the 9<sup>th</sup> Schedule, ince Article 21 was trigerred, they would have to be subjected to the test of fundamental rights.<br>
The court also asserted that if any legislation added into the 9<sup>th</sup> Schedule sought to nullify the principles of the 'golden triangle', it would be declared void.<br>
All amendments seeking to insert legislation into the 9<sup>th</sup> Schedule would be subjected to a 2 fold test:

<ol>
<li>Did they conform with the basic structure of the Constitution?</li>
<li>Did they conform with the fundamental rights as forming a part of the basic structure under Part III of the Constitution? </li>
</ol>

The court unanimously concluded that government could not use 9<sup>th</sup> Schedule as the 'black hole' of the Constitution.<br>
<i>Coelho</i> has preserved the supremacy of the judiciary in constitutional adjudication.<br>
