In 1978, a prosperous Muslim husband unilaterally divorced Shah Bano, after forty years of marriage by pronouncing 'triple talaq`.<br>
This abrupt divorce was because of an inheritance dispute between the children of Shah Bano and those of the husband's other wife.<br>
Now, as mandated by the Muslliin law, the husbad paid ₹3000 (the pre-agreed <i>mahr</i> amount) during <i>iddat</i>.<br>
Shah Bano filed a petition under Section 125 of CrPC before Judicial Magistrate at Indore.<br>
She claimed maintenance from her husband who had an annual professional income of ₹60000.<br>
The magistrate asked the husbanf to pay a mere ₹25 per month to the wife as maintenance.<br>
When Shah Bano appealed the case to Madhya Pradesh High Court, the maintenance amount was revised to ₹179.2 per month.<br>
There were already 2 Supreme Court decisions precisely stating that te court could order a maintenance payment under Section 125, thus it was pretty straightforward case.<br>
However, when the matter came before a two-judge bench, the judges thought that the previous judgements were not robust.<br>
Therefore, a five-judge Constitution Bench was formed to resolve the issue.<br>
Interestingly, of these 5 jusges, 4 were Hindu while the fifth, Justice O. Chinnappa Reddy, 'rejected any religious label'.<br>
MoMohammed Ahmed Khan argued that according to Muslim law, a husband's lisbility after divorce extended only up to <i>iddat</i> period.<br>
Moreover, Section 125 was liable to be cancelled under Section 127.<br>
The Supreme Court eloquently framed the agonizing questions before it in the <i>Shah Bano</i> case:

<p style="text-align:center;">
Is this law so ruthless in its inquality that, no matter how much husband pays for maintenance of his dovorced wife during the period of iddat.<br>
The mere fact that he has paid something, no matter how little, absolves him forever from the duty of paying adequately so as to enable her to keep her body and soul together?<br>
The again, is there any provision in the Muslim Personal Law under which a sum is payable to wife 'on divorce'?
