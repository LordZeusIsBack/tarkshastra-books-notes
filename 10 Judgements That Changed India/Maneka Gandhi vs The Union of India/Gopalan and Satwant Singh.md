In 1950, Supreme Court was asked to interpret fundamental rights for the first time.<br>
A.K. Gopalan, social and political worker, filed a habeas corpus seeking his release from detention under Preventative Detention Act, 1950.<br>
Claimed this act prevented Article 13, 19, 21 and 22 of the Indian Constitution.<br>
Petitioner said that all the Articles were to be read collectively in tandem.<br>
Supreme Court disagreed, holding that fundamental rights should be held in isolation.<br>
When the law meets the requirements of fundamental rights applying to it, it cannot be said that the law is against any other fundamental right.<br>
Since the law did not violate Article 22 (safeguards against preventive detention), the petitioner did not have any grounds to challenge the law under any other fundamental right like Article 22.<br>
The court refused any similarity between the American 'due process clause' and the expression 'procedure established by the law' as found in Article 21.<br>
In <i>Gopalan</i>, the majority opinion was based what it preceived the historical interpretation of Constitution.<br>
Court's decision in <i>Gopalan</i> was 'positivist' and gave 'finality to the law established by the legislature'.<br>
The <i>Maneka Gandhi</i> case conerned the fundamental right of an Indian Citizen to travel abroad.<br>
There was a conflict of opinion among different high courts of the country that whether the right to travel abroad formed a part of right to personal liberty under Article 21.<br>
This conflict was resolved by Supreme Court in <i>Satwant Singh v. Assistant Passport Officer, Government of India</i>.<br>
Satwant Singh was a manufacturer, importer and exporter of automobile parts and engineering goods.<br>
The External Affairs Ministry asked him to surrender his passport on the grounds that he was likely to leave India to avoid trial he was expected to face.<br>
He moved to Supreme Court contending that the state's action violated his Article 14 and 21.<br>
Supreme Court concluded taht the word 'liberty' under Article 21 had a wide import and excluded only was was expressly protected under Article 19.<br>
The court recognized that right to life and personal liberty could be taken away by 'procedure established by the law'.<br>
However, it cancelled the government's order to the petitioner to surrender his passport.<br>
The court's objection was based on absense of procedure rather than merits of existing system.<br>
After this judgement, Passports Act, 1967 was passed which made sure that nothing like this could ever exist.<br>
