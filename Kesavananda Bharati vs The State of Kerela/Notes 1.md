Clash between the judiciary and the legislature.<br>
Judgement delivered on 24 April, 1973.<br>
It was unique for a number of reasons.<br>
&emsp;1. Anxious political circumstances under which it was delivered (Attempts by Indira Gandhi-led INC Government to pass radical constitutional amendments.)<br>
&emsp;2. Shift in the balance of democratic power it caused.<br>
&emsp;3. The unprecedented number of separate opinions delivered by the Court.<br>
Longest case in the history of the country.<br>
Judgement spans 800 pages and about 420,000 words long.<br>
Termed as "Longest Appellate Decision" of the last century.<br>
Supreme Court ascribed to itself the function of preserving the integrity of the Indian Constitution.<br>
This case analysis is incomplete without a brief discussion of cases which led up to this judgement.<br>
