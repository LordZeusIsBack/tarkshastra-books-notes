In India, all citizens are equal.<br>
Therefore, there is a common set of laws that binds all citizens, irrespective of sex, caste etc.<br>
However, water gets murky when it comes to matters involving family matters - marriage, succession etc.<br>
These laws are termsed as 'personal laws' and administration according to them have led to harsh and unjust rulings.<br>
Constitution of India talks about Uniform Civil Code (UCC) to eliminate this very regime in article 44.<br>
In 1970s and '80s, there were several conflicts surrounding the personal laws governing Muslims.<br>
Section 125 of Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) was one such area of confliict.<br>
According to this section, First Class Magistrate could order a husband to provide a monthly allowance upto â‚¹500 to the divorcee if she was unable to maintain herself.<br>
Incase the husband disobeyed the order, he could be imprisoned.<br>
This law thought to bring swift relief to women who were financially dependent.<br>
Section 127 of CrPC provides that if a wife was paid any money on divorce under personal law, any order passed under Section 125 was to be cancelled.<br>
The main purpose was that if the wife wereprovided under perosnal law, and she would not proceed to double-dip the husband.<br>
<i>Mahr</i> is a marriage-gft given to bride in Islam, settled uponbefore marriage.<br>
It may be given at the time of marriage ot deferred at a later date.<br>
In many cases, <i>mahr</i> was deferred at the time of husband's death or divorce.<br>
The Supreme Court faced a dilemma in 2 terms:

<p style='text-align:center'>Would the payment of <i>mahr</i>, regardless of insignificance, absove a Muslim husband from Section 125 of CrPC?
</p>
The court answered in negative stating that if the payment of <i>mahr</i> was no bar of granting the maintenance.<br>
If the <i>mahr</i> amount were insufficient, the court was free to order the payment of maintenance.<br>
