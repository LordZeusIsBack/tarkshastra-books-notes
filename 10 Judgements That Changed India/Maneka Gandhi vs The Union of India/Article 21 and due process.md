Part III of the Indian Constitution is the most significant component for 2 reasons:<br>

<ol>
<li>Any law that takes away rights as conferred in Part III is void.</li>
<li>Every person is entitled to approach the Supreme Court directly for enforce his/her rights under Part III.</li>
</ol>
Amongst the fundamental rights, Article 14, 19 and 21 have been called most often to declare any law arbitrary.<br>
These are called the 'Golgen Triangle'.<br>
Article 14 categoricallly sets out that the state cannot deny any person equality before the law.<br>
Article 19 grants 6 rights to all the citizens of India.<br>
Right to life and personal liberty under Article 21 read:<br>
&emsp;<i>No person shall be deprived of his life or personal libertyexcept according to procedure established by the law.</i><br>
The phrase 'procedure established by the law' was the subject of profound debate in the Constituent Assembly.<br>
Would the deprivation of citizens life or personal liberty be undertaken under 'procedure established by the law' or 'due process of law'?<br>
