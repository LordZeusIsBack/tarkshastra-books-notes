The Court issued 11 separate opinions on the matter.<br>
For the first time in history, jusges gave a summary of their decision.<br>
The Majority of the views on each issue were as follows:

</ol>
<li>The 24<sup>th</sup> Amendment to the Constitution was valid.<br></li>
<li>The 25<sup>th</sup> Amendment to the Constitution was valid excpet the part which ousted the court's jurisdiction.<br></li>
<li>The 29<sup>th</sup> Amendment to the Constitution was valid.<br></li>
<li>The <i>Golak Nath</i> judgement, which had assrted that fundamental rights could not be taken away, was overruled.<br></li>
<li>There were no implied limitations to the Parliament's power to amend the Constitution according to article 368.<br><br></li>
</ol>

However, the most important judgement was made by a thin margin of 7:6 where the court said although the Parliament had the power to amend the Constitution, it could not use this power to alter or destroy the basic framework of the Constitution.<br>
All Constitutional Amendments made after <i>Kesvananda</i>, would have to pass the 'basic-structure filter' created by the Supreme Court.<br>
The court empowered itself to judge the constitutionality of amendments.<br>
Coming to the judgement of the Supreme Court, there was no unanimity of opinion on what the basic structure was.<br>
Each judge in the majority prepared a list of what, according to them , comprised the basic structure.<br>
Chirf Justice Sikri listed: supremacy of the Constitution, republican and democratic form of government, secular character of the Constitution, separation of powers and the federal structure of the Constitution, as basic structure of the Constitution.<br>
Justice Shelat and Justice Grover reproduced, broadly, a similar list, with the following 2 additional elements: dignity of the individual and mandate to build a welfare state and the unity and the integrity of the nation.<br>
Justice Hegde and Justice Mukehrjea listed: sovereignity of India, democratic character of of India's polity, unity of country, essential features of the individual freedom secured to the citizen and a mandate to build a welfare state and egalitarian society.<br>
Justice Jagan Mohan Reddy's basic features comprised: sovereign democratic republic, parliamentary democracy and the 3 prgans of the state.<br>
