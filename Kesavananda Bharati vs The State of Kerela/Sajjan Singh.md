In <i>Sajjan Singh v. State of Rajasthan</i>, the validity of the Seventeenth Amendment, which inserted 44 statures into the 9<sup>th</sup> Schedule, was challenged before another 5-judge bench.<br>
Unlike in <i>Shankari Prasad</i>, the Parliament's rooght to amend fundamental rights was not questioned.<br>
Instead, the case challenged the Parliament's failure to follow procedure prescribed to amend the constitution.<br>
This was also dismissed unanimously by the bench.<br>
However, 3 judges aggreed that fundamental rights could not be amended, ehilw justice Mohammend Hidayatullah and Justice Janardhan Rahunath Mudholkar expressed expressed doubts about the correctness of the view adopted in <i>Shankari Prasad</i> that an amendment to the Constitution was not 'law' under Article 13(2) of the Constitution.<br>
In facts, Justice sowed the seeds for the doctrine adopted in <i>Kesavananda</i> when he reddered to the 'intention og thr Constituent Assembky to give permanency to the basic festures of the Constitution'.<br>
He said, "It is also a matter for consideration wheater making a change in a basic feature of the Constitution can be regarded merely as an amendment or would it be, in effect, rewriting a part of the Constitution."<br>
