The then Cihef Justice of India, Justice S.M. Sikri, was due to retire a day after the <i>Kesvananda</i> decision.<br>
The government was yet to announce his successor.<br>
As per convention, the senior-most judge is appointed as the CJI.<br>
If this convention would have followed, the Chief Justiceship would have been accorded to Justice Shelat followed by Justices Grover and Hegde.<br>
however, angered with the decision of <i>Kesvananda</i> decision, the government superseded thse 3 judges and appointed Justice A.N. Ray, who ruled in the favour of the government and against petitioners.<br>
This undermined the long standing practice of appointing the senior-most judges of Supreme Court.<br>
Justices Shelat, Grover and Hegde resigned in protest and the Indira government's attempt to muzzle judiciary in the lead up to emergency started in earnest.<br>
Soon after, Raj Narain, Indira Gandhi's political rival, challenged her election to the Lok Sabha from rae Bareli in the Ahemdabad High Court.<br>
He alleged that Indira Gandhi had committed corrupt practices under Representation of People's Act, 1951.<br>
Accepting this contention, the court voided Indira's election.<br>
On appeal to Supreme Court, the judgement of Allahbad high Court was stayed and it was held that Indira Gandhi could continue to function as Prime Minister of India on the condition that she would not draw salary, speak or vote in Parliament.<br>
The fallout of this judgement was that a National Emergency was proclaimed in India on 25 June, 1975.<br>
It lasted for 21 months.<br>
During the Emergency, the Parliament hurriedly passed the 39<sup>th</sup> Amendment, placing the election of President, PM, Vice PM and Speaker of Lok Sabha beyond the scrutinty of the courts.<br>
This was meant to nullify the ruling of the Allahbad High Court.<br>
In <i>Indira Nehru Gandhi v. Raj Narain</i>, Raj Narain challenged the validity of the amendment itself.<br>
It was for the first time a constitutional amendment was challenged not in respect to right to property or social affair, but with reference to an electoral law.<br>
By a clear majority of 4:1, the Supreme Court ruled in the favour of Raj Narain.<br>
However, Indira Gandhi's election was not affecetd, since the court upheld retrospective amendments to electoral laws.<br>
