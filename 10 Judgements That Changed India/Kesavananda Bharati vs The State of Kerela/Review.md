In the midst of the National Emergency, the CJI A.N. Ray constituted a 13 judge bench to review Supreme Court's decision in <i>Kesvananda</i>.<br>
The bench was dissolved after 2 days of hearing.<br>
Much of what transpired was shrouded in secrecy.<br>
The reporting of the court's judgement by press was also restricted at the time.<br>
One of the principal arguements for review of <i>Kesvananda</i> was that basic structure was nebulous.<br>
The Supreme Court right chose uncertain democracy over certain tyranny.<br>
